Hi! I'm passionate about designing for development by leveraging `data and machine learning (ML)` to tackle complex social and environmental challenges. My research and work mainly focuses on `health technology`, particularly exploring practical applications that enhance mental, physical, and general wellbeing for individuals.

I completed my BS degree in Computer Science from the Lahore University of Management Science (LUMS). My senior year project focused on the efficacy of using conversational agents for mental health support from a religio-cultural perspective. I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the LUMS [AI in Healthcare Initiative (AIHI)](https://www.ai-hi.org/home) and [Centre for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)](https://www.c-salt.org/). Here, I led the development and pilot deployment of Darcheeni, a contextually-aware AI-enabled physicians assistant. Currently, I'm a research and data analyst at SHAPE Global, where I help organisations and employees understand and improve wellbeing through data-driven insights.
