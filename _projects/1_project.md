Darcheeni (now SensAI) is an AI-enabled physician assistant which listens to the doctor-patient conversation, elicits contextualized medical decision-making, and develops a personalized assessment and plan for each patient.

As the technical lead, I led the following aspects of the project:
1. Machine Learning for transcription, translation (including low-resource languages), and clinical decision-making. `Primary Focus`
2. Design efforts, including site visits, patient and doctor interviews, and user experience research
3. Business endeavors, such as creating slide decks and presenting to potential investors
